ALX PWA 0x01: Cine Seek Movie App - Progressive Web App Implementation
This repository showcases the transformation of a Next.js movie application into a Progressive Web App (PWA). The project integrates the next-pwa package to enable core PWA features, including offline capabilities, installability, and a native-app-like user experience.

Project Objectives:
The main goals for this project were:

PWA Feature Enablement: Successfully integrate and configure the next-pwa package within a Next.js environment.

Metadata Definition: Create and link a Web App Manifest (manifest.json) to provide essential PWA metadata and icons.

Local Verification: Test PWA features (Service Worker registration, Manifest loading) using browser developer tools.

Deployment & Installability: Deploy the PWA to a hosting platform (Vercel) and verify its installability on mobile devices.

Project Structure:
The main application code resides in the alx-movie-app/ directory within this repository.

Tasks Completed:
Here's a detailed breakdown of the tasks accomplished in this project:

0. Install Necessary Dependencies üì¶
Objective: To set up the next-pwa package and webpack to enable PWA features in our Cine Seek movie app.

Files Affected: package.json

Description:

The alx-project-0x14 repository was cloned into a new project directory named alx-pwa-0x01.

Navigated into the alx-movie-app subdirectory, which contains the core application.

The essential PWA package, @ducanh2912/next-pwa, was installed using npm i @ducanh2912/next-pwa. This package is fundamental for handling service worker generation and web manifest integration within a Next.js app.

webpack was installed as a development dependency using npm i -D webpack. Webpack is an internal tool Next.js uses for bundling, and next-pwa often requires it to be explicitly available.

The package.json file was verified to ensure both @ducanh2912/next-pwa (version ^10.2.9 or higher) and webpack (version ^5.94.0 or higher) were correctly listed in their respective dependencies and devDependencies sections.

1. Configure PWA in Next.js ‚öôÔ∏è
Objective: To update or create the next.config.mjs file to seamlessly integrate the next-pwa package with the Next.js application.

Files Affected: next.config.mjs

Description:

The next.config.mjs file, located in the root of the alx-movie-app directory, was created (if it didn't exist) or updated.

The @ducanh2912/next-pwa plugin was imported and initialized as withPWAInit({ dest: 'public' }). This configuration instructs the plugin to output generated PWA-related assets (like the service worker) into the public directory.

The existing Next.js configurations, such as reactStrictMode: true and images: { domains: ['m.media-amazon.com'] }, were preserved.

The entire nextConfig object was then exported, wrapped by the withPWA function. This step is critical as it tells Next.js to apply all PWA capabilities‚Äîincluding automatic service worker generation and manifest handling‚Äîto the application.

2. Create a Web App Manifest üìÑüñºÔ∏è
Objective: To define the PWA's metadata and iconography by setting up a manifest.json file.

Files Affected: public/manifest.json, public/icons/android-chrome-192x192.png, public/icons/apple-icon-152x152.png, public/icons/ms-icon-310x310.png

Description:

A manifest.json file was created within the public directory.

This file was populated with essential PWA metadata:

name: "Cine Seek" (the full name of the application)

short_name: "CineSeek" (a shorter name for home screen icons)

theme_color: "#FFFFFF" (defines the color of the browser's UI elements)

background_color: "#FFFFFF" (defines the background color when the PWA is launching)

start_url: "/" (the URL to load when the PWA is launched)

display: "standalone" (makes the app launch in its own window, without browser UI)

orientation: "portrait" (prefers a portrait orientation)

An icons array was meticulously defined within manifest.json. This array specifies paths, sizes, and types for various application icons (android-chrome-192x192.png, apple-icon-152x152.png, ms-icon-310x310.png) crucial for PWA installability across different operating systems and devices.

A new public/icons directory was created. The corresponding icon image files, generated using an external PWA icon generator tool, were placed in this directory, ensuring their names and sizes precisely matched the specifications in manifest.json.

3. Link the Manifest in _document.tsx üîó
Objective: To ensure the manifest.json is correctly linked in the application's HTML for the browser to recognize PWA functionality.

Files Affected: pages/_document.tsx

Description:

The pages/_document.tsx file was opened (or created if it didn't exist) in the pages directory. This special Next.js file allows customization of the root <html> and <body> structure.

Within the <Head> section of _document.tsx, a <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" /> tag was added. This HTML tag is what explicitly tells the browser where to find the Web App Manifest.

A <meta name="theme-color" content="#0070f3" /> meta tag was also included. This tag sets the theme color for the browser's user interface, such as the address bar on mobile devices, providing a more integrated native app feel.

4. Test and Deploy Your PWA (Bonus) ‚úÖüöÄ
Objective: To verify the application's PWA functionality locally and then deploy it to a hosting platform to test installability.

Files Affected: No code files directly, but involves local testing and deployment via Vercel CLI.

Description:

The application was run locally using npm run dev.

Chrome DevTools (F12) were utilized to inspect the "Application" tab. This confirmed that the Service Worker was successfully registered and active, and the manifest.json was loaded correctly, displaying all defined metadata and icons.

The Vercel CLI tool was installed globally (npm install -g vercel).

The application was deployed to Vercel by running vercel in the project's root directory and following the interactive prompts to link the project to the GitHub repository.

The generated Vercel deployment URL was then accessed on a mobile device (or using a mobile simulator in browser DevTools). This crucial step allowed for verification of PWA installability (e.g., the "Add to Home Screen" prompt on Android or iOS).

Setup and Running the Application
To set up and run this project locally:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/KiriManii/alx-project-0x14.git alx-pwa-0x01

Navigate to the project directory:

cd alx-pwa-0x01/alx-movie-app

Install dependencies:

npm install

(This command ensures all packages, including PWA-related ones, are installed.)

Run the development server:

npm run dev

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
